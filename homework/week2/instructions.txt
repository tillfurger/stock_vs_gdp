# The Dockerfile references a /plot_home directory, which should be inputed
while running the docker image. For example, if the image is built as "plot_app",
the image should be run using the -v flag as follows:

docker run --rm -v `pwd`:/plot_home plot_app

where pwd will be the result of the "pwd" command line command, so it is important
that the docker run command is executed from the directory where the data/ subfolder
and the plot.py file are stored.
