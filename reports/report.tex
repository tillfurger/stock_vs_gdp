\begin{abstract} 
\noindent In order to show our programming skills learned in the exciting course "Digital Tools in Finance" we are
	handing in a short paper, describing the relationship of the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) and stock
	market growth in the United States of America. We find that over the time period observed the stock market grew
	almost seven times more the national GDP.
