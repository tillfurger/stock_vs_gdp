	abstract = {We study trends and drivers of long-run stock market growth in 17 advanced economies. Between 1870 and the 1980s, stock market capitalization grew in line with GDP. But over subsequent decades, an unprecedented expansion saw market cap to GDP ratios triple and remain persistently high. While most historical stock market growth was driven by issuances, this recent expansion was fueled by rising equity prices. We show that the key driver of this structural break was a profit shift towards listed firms, with listed firm profit shares in both GDP and capital income doubling to reach their highest levels in 146 years.},

	abstract = {This research is aimed at assessing the impact of the stock market capitalization and the banking spread in per capita economic growth (as a proxy of economic development) in the major Latin American economies during period 1994–2012. To do this, a panel data model is estimated with both system and difference Generalized Method of Moments. The main empirical findings are that economic growth in the countries under study is positively impacted by the stock market capitalization and negatively by the banking spread. Typical problems of multicollinearity and autocorrelation appearing in panel data analysis are corrected under the proposed methodology.
Resumen
Esta investigación tiene como objetivo evaluar el impacto de la capitalización de mercado de valores y el spread bancario en el crecimiento económico per cápita (como proxy del desarrollo económico) en las principales economías de América Latina durante el período 1994-2012. Para ello, se estima un modelo de datos de panel con el Método Generalizado de Momentos tanto en sistema como en diferencias. Los principales hallazgos empíricos son que el crecimiento económico en los países estudiados es afectado positivamente por la capitalización bursátil y negativamente por el spread bancario. Los problemas típicos de multicolinealidad y autocorrelación que aparece en el análisis de datos de panel son corregidos bajo la metodología propuesta.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the relationship between stock market capitalization to GDP and real GDP in 10 Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) that joined the European Union in 2004 and 2007, with the objective of determining whether the financial markets played a role as drivers of economic development in these countries or vice versa. The methodology, using a cointegrated Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model, is based on the application of three different measures of causality: Granger causality test, Toda-Yamamoto approach and Frequency Domain approach. The results obtained suggest evidence of a causal relationship in both directions between the variables in a significant number of countries, and especially in those where the variables show to be clearly cointegrated (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia).},

	abstract = {The analysis of a possible positive relationship between economic growth and stock market returns is interesting both theoretically and practically. Investors often wonder if they should assign higher weight to countries with higher economic performance, hoping that economic growth will eventually show up in equity returns. Although this relationship seems quite intuitive, historically long-run stock price growth has fallen short of GDP growth in many countries. In this bulletin, we use long-term equity data to analyze the steps leading from GDP to stock prices, and point out several factors that could explain why GDP growth is diluted before it can reach shareholders.},
